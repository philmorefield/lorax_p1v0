Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Ages 85-100."
"2. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"

"5. Connecticut population estimates for 2022 and later years are reported for 9 planning regions as county equivalent areas,"
"instead of the former 8 legacy counties in the Vintage 2022 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 22, 2023,"

"certificates to include a cause of death code indicating drug overdose (ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes: X40-X44,"
"X60-X64, X85, and Y10-Y14). Jurisdictions can continue to update death certificates after the closing of the mortality file. As"
"a result, users should consider that the actual death count for drug overdose deaths for North Carolina in 2023 is over 4,400"
"deaths, with a crude rate of approximately 41.0 per 100,000 population, and an age-adjusted rate of approximately 42.1 per"
"100,000 population. These deaths will not be updated on the final mortality datasets."
