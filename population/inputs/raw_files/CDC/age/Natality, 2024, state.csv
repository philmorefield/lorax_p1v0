Caveats:
"1. 'Not Available' appears when the denominator population for a rate measure is not available."
"2. 'Suppressed' appears when the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/natality-expanded.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"4. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then"
"the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set"
"mother's age selecting some years not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included"
"in the denominator population. If you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, then ""Not"
"Available"" is reported for the denominator population."
"5. Birth rates and fertility rates are calculated using the following populations: The populations for year 2024 are from the"
"postcensal single race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau on June 26, 2025. The"
