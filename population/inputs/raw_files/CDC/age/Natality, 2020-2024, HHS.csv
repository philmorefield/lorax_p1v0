Caveats:
"1. 'Not Available' appears when the denominator population for a rate measure is not available."
"2. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"3. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then"
"the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set"
"mother's age selecting some years not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included"
"in the denominator population. If you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, then ""Not"
"Available"" is reported for the denominator population."
"4. Birth rates and fertility rates are calculated using the following populations: The populations for year 2024 are from the"
