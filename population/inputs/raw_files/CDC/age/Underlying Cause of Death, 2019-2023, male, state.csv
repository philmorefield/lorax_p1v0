"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"

"a result, users should consider that the actual death count for drug overdose deaths for North Carolina in 2023 is over 4,400"
"deaths, with a crude rate of approximately 41.0 per 100,000 population, and an age-adjusted rate of approximately 42.1 per"
